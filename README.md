## Todo

A long with this [checklist](http://phppackagechecklist.com/#1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,13) the below is still to be done.

- Write actual docs. (Prerequisites, Installation, Setup, Usage)
- Write tests.
- Make sure it works with a global composer install.
- Store servers.json in a better location (similar to composer e.g. ~/.mersey).
- create servers.json.example.
